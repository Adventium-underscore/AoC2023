# Advent of Code 2023
This is a repository of my solutions to Advent of Code 2023. At the moment, I'm solving each day in Python and later rewriting the solution in Rust to get more comfortable with it.
I might update this repository daily, I might not. We'll see.

I did do some of AoC last year, but got stuck on Day 12 because I know nothing about pathfinding and didn't have any motivation to skip and do the rest of the days.
